## What is Championship Manager

Championship Manager was a football management simulator computer game, that I wasted many hours playing during the course of my younger years. It used a commentary text based system to show live highlights of a match.

## What is a speed reader

Software that aids in improving your ability to read quickly. Splits the long passage of text in to smaller readable chunk.

## Why

As mentioned I enjoyed the Championship Manager loads and wanted to pay homage to the game.
